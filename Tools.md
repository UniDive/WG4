Authors: Daniel Nettle <br>
Type: publication <br>
Brief description: The authors modelled language diversity in terms of richness (the number of different languages in a given geographical area), phylogenetic diversity (the number of different
lineages in the phylogenetic tree of languages) or structural diversity (variation among structures within languages). 
This is about inter-linguistic diversity.<br>

Authors: David Harmon, Jonathan Loh <br>
Type: publication <br>
Brief description: The authors propose indices to follow the number of world’s active languages, the distribution of mother-tongue speakers among them and the rate of language extinction. The measures are based on a database of time-series data on language demographics. <br>
