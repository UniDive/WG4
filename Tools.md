Title: [Linguistic diversity](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/language-in-society/article/abs/daniel-nettle-linguistic-diversity-oxford-new-york-oxford-university-press-1999-pp-xi-168-hb-6500-pb-1995/99CDDE1F8F0ECBD609C242BF01F7E773)<br>
Authors: Daniel Nettle <br>
Type: publication <br>
Brief description: The authors modelled language diversity in terms of richness (the number of different languages in a given geographical area), phylogenetic diversity (the number of different
lineages in the phylogenetic tree of languages) or structural diversity (variation among structures within languages). 
This is about inter-linguistic diversity.<br>

Title: [The index of linguistic diversity: A new quantitative measure of trends in the status of the world’s languages](https://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/items/761a86b0-9afd-43c9-b4a2-1800bad2158d)<br>
Authors: David Harmon, Jonathan Loh <br>
Type: publication <br>
Brief description: The authors propose indices to follow the number of world’s active languages, the distribution of mother-tongue speakers among them and the rate of language extinction. The measures are based on a database of time-series data on language demographics. This is about inter-linguistic diversity.<br>

Title: [Measuring diversity in multilingual communication](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11205-019-02161-5)<br>
Authors: Michele Gazzola, Torsten Templin, Lisa J. McEnteeAtalianis<br>
Type: publication <br>
Brief description: Socio-linguistic diversity is measured in terms of the probability of using more than one common language in multilingual communication, as well as the degree of diversity of language policies. This is about inter-linguistic diversity.<br>

Title: [A Diversity-Promoting Objective Function for Neural Conversation Models](https://aclanthology.org/N16-1014.pdf)<br>
Authors: Jiwei Li, Michel Galley, Chris Brockett, Jianfeng Gao, and Bill Dolan<br>
Type: publication <br>
Brief description: The authors stress the problem of the lack of diversity in the outputs of neural conversational systems and propose an diversity-driven objective function which addresses this problem.<br>

Title: [A Diversity-Promoting Objective Function for Neural Conversation Models](https://aclanthology.org/N16-1014.pdf)<br>
Authors: Jiwei Li, Michel Galley, Chris Brockett, Jianfeng Gao, and Bill Dolan<br>
Type: publication <br>
Brief description: The authors stress the problem of the lack of diversity in the outputs of neural conversational systems and propose an diversity-driven objective function which addresses this problem. The diversity is measured in terms of the number of distinct unigrams and bigrams in generated text.<br>

Title: [Trading Off Diversity and Quality in Natural Language Generation](https://aclanthology.org/2021.humeval-1.3/)<br>
Authors: Hugh Zhang, Daniel Duckworth, Daphne Ippolito, Arvind Neelakantan<br>
Type: publication <br>
Brief description: The authors address NL generation and study the tradeoff between generation quality and diversity. In experiments they use Shannon’s entropy (measures which relate to richness and balance, respectively).<br>

Title: [SemEval-2016 Task 1: Semantic Textual Similarity, Monolingual and Cross-Lingual Evaluation](https://aclanthology.org/S16-1081.pdf)<br>
Authors: Eneko Agirre, Carmen Banea, Daniel Cer, Mona Diab, Aitor Gonzalez-Agirre, Rada Mihalcea, German Rigau, and Janyce Wiebe<br>
Type: publication <br>
Brief description: The authors describe a SemEval shared task on estimating the degree of semantic equivalence between two snippets of text. To select datasets in which the range of topics would be diverse enough, they use the measure of word embedding similarity, i.e. the average cosine distance between utterance embeddings.<br>

Title: [Texygen: A Benchmarking Platform for Text Generation Models](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3209978.3210080)<br>
Authors: Yaoming Zhu, Sidi Lu, Lei Zheng, Jiaxian Guo, Weinan Zhang, Jun Wang, and Yong Yu<br>
Type: publication <br>
Brief description: The authors describe Texygen, a benchmarking platform to support open-domain text generation. It covers a set of metrics that evaluate the diversity, the quality and the consistency of the generated texts. To measure diversity they use SelfBLEU, i.e. the BLEU measure applied to generated utterances rather than to the reference.<br>

Title: [Semantic Diversity for Natural Language Understanding Evaluation in Dialog Systems](https://aclanthology.org/2020.coling-industry.5/)<br>
Authors: Enrico Palumbo, Andrea Mezzalira, Cristina Marco, Alessandro Manzotti, and Daniele Amberti<br>
Type: publication <br>
Brief description: The authors address Natural Language Understanding in dialog systems and address the problem of creating a test set of utterances that covers a diversity of possible customer requests. The diversity measures are: SelfBLUE (as in Zhu et al. 2018), Jaccard (average word overlap across test utterances) and Word Embedding Diversity (average cosine distance between embeddings of vectors in the test set).<br>
