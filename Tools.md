Brief description: The authors modelled language diversity in terms of richness (the number of different languages in a given geographical area), phylogenetic diversity (the number of different
lineages in the phylogenetic tree of languages) or structural diversity (variation among structures within languages). 
This is about inter-linguistic diversity.
