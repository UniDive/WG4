# WG4
This GitHub repository is intended as a central hub for the members of UniDive Working Group 4, to collect and share resources relating to measuring diversity in language. 

Markdown pages have been created for documenting resources under the headings of *Data*, *Research*, and *Tools*.

*Data* includes all digital collections of language data, whether text, audio, or video, capturing measures of diversity in some way. This includes corpora annotated with human judgements, lexicons, parsed data (i.e. treebanks), metadata collections, data collected from minority groups, etc.

*Research* includes all research efforts (by individuals or groups of people) relating to measuring diversity in language. This includes publications, surveys, guidelines, projects, networks, workshops, shared tasks, and dedicated research groups.

*Tools* are any computational assets for quantifying, analysing, or processing measures of diversity in language data. This mainly includes software, but also metrics, stylesheets, and document-type definitions.

**Example of documenting a resource:**

Title: [Evaluating Diversity of Multiword Expressions in Annotated Text](https://aclanthology.org/2022.coling-1.290/)<br>
Authors: Adam Lion-Bouton, Yagmur Ozturk, Agata Savary, Jean-Yves Antoine <br>
Type: publication <br>
Brief description: A paper published at COLING 2022, describing measures of diversity applied to MWEs annotated in 14 languages. <br>

The title is accurate to the resource, and the hyperlink points to the metapage of the publication, which provides additional information about the resource. Use the markdown for hyperlink: title between [brackets] and hyperlink between (parentheses). Authors and the type of resource are given, and a brief description is included to explain what the resource is, and why it has been included, which will be helpful when organising and summarising the collection of resources later.

Before adding a new resource, make sure it's not already in the document :-) Thanks!
